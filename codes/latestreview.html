<h1>The Conjuring(2013)</h1>
<h3>User reviews</h3>
<h5>a modern classic</h5>
<p>It's several years since this film was released, and I have 
    to say that none of the shine has come off it, the quality is still very much
     there, the film is a classic. As a horror it packs in some real scares
     , but there is so much more to it, it has tension, a story, and some real intrigue,
      possibly because of the fact that it was inspired by real life events.

    Several films have followed, sequels and spin offs, but none of them come
     close to this, the only Horror film for many years to actually give me a few scares.
    
    Many of the scares are so memorable, because they are so well executed, 
    they got the balance just right.</p>
    <h5>New life breathed into a classic sub-genre</h5>
    <p>Don't summon the devil, don't call the priest ..."

        I was one of a lucky few to have seen The Conjuring 
        at a preview screening for FrightFest 2013.
        
        I went in totally cold, not having seen a trailer,
         nor knowing anything about the story or plot and it 
        turned out to be one of the best scary horror movies I have ever seen.</p>
        <h1>Annabelle(2014)</h1>
        <h5>headline</h5>
        <p>Re-watched this one recently and now I remember why 
            it didn't really leave an impression like it's sequels.
             as the first of the trilogy it had the burden of building the
              characters and world up, which it failed to do. none of th
              e characters felt fleshed out, leaving the viewer to not
               really care what happens to any of them. for most of the 
               film you feel as if you're watching a slice of life film instead 
               of a horror one. it finally starts to pickup halfway through the
                film although the ending doesn't really feel earned and the 
                conflict happens and dies out too quickly as if it remembered 
                it had to happen. the second film did a way better job at being 
                a spin-off film for this important entity of The Conjuring universe.</p>
                <h5>Pitiful cash-grab.</h5>
                <p>Horror is one of my favorite movie genres.
                     I really wasn't expecting to hate this as much as
                      I did but it is astonishingly terrible. Really. I loved 
                      The Conjuring - this is nothing like The Conjuring. At all.
                       It's a blatant cash-grab and a terrible one at that.

                    There is zero tension throughout this movie.
                     Zero suspense. Everything is reliant on close ups
                      of the dolls face to "creep" us out and really long periods
                       of time where NOTHING HAPPENS. Literally, it's about this couple 
                       that we do not care about and their stupid problems which we care
                        even less about. I don't know if they were trying to build suspense 
                        in these scenes but in order to build suspense you actually have to
                         care about the characters. Or at least have, you know, suspense; a
                          lingering sense of danger. This had nothing. And holy hell that
                           ending.</p>
