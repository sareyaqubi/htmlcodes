    <h1>Top Rated </h1>
    <h3>The Conjuring</h3>
    <p>Between These three horror movies, Conjuring is the most popular.
        The actors were perfect.The Conjuring's use of tension, atmosphere,
        and suggestion prove that the scariest thing to an audience has
         nothing to do with what you see, but what you don't.
    </p>
    <h3>The Annabelle</h3>
    <p>After Conjuring Annabelle was the top rated horror movie.Though the film has the solid
         production design, cinematography and score that one can typically expect from The
          Conjuring Universe, the story and its characters are dull, lifeless, and generic</p>
